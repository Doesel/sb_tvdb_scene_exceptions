How to add exceptions<br />
<br />
1) Check TVDB<br />
- get the TVDB ID of the show<br />
- search for any similar shows that could conflict, note them<br />
<br />
2) Check NZBMatrix/NZBs.org<br />
- find all scene names of the correct show<br />
- find any shows which may conflict because of similar names<br />
<br />
3) Fixup scene names from step 2<br />
- for each scene name turn it back into a show name. This means adding back parentheses, apostrophes, ampersands, colons, exclamation marks, and question marks.<br />
eg. Shows.Name.2010 -> Show's Name! (2010) (since SB will turn that back into Shows.Name.2010)<br />
<br />
Remember that this list overrides the original name, it doesn't append to it. So if the original name is valid in addition to the exception you will have to put both of them in the exception list.<br />
<br />
Exceptions should be of the format:<br />
<br />
tvdb_id: 'Name 1', 'Name 2', ..., 'Name N'<br />
<br />
Apostrophes inside the show name should be escaped with a backslash ('Show\'s Name').
